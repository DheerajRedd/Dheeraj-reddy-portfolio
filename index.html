            <p>Developed API endpoints and methods for fetching and filtering data related to fashionable clothes, trending 
                collections, and user profiles. Ensured a smooth and intuitive user experience with consistent UI design patterns, 
                clear visual hierarchy, easy-to-read typography, and accessibility standards. Tested the API endpoints using tools 
                such as Postman or Swagger to ensure they are working as expected, and handled error responses, input

            Wirefly is a network plan finder application implemented using Java, JavaScript, Node.js, React.js, and MongoDB. It offers users an easy platform to find and join mobile plans. Technical skills used include Java, Node.js, and MongoDB for backend development, React.js for frontend development, and thorough QA/QC processes. The Java and Node.js combination ensured a scalable and reliable backend infrastructure, while React.js provided a dynamic user interface. MongoDB served as the NoSQL database for efficient data storage and retrieval. QA/QC activities included code testing with JUnit and Jest, usability testing, and incorporating user feedback. The application successfully met its objectives by delivering a seamless user experience for discovering and joining mobile plans.</p>

        <h2>Pet Care Web Application 2.0</h2>
        <p> Developed the Pet care web application using the Spring Boot framework, Hibernate ORM, and MariaDB as the relational database management system. The application employed RESTful web services, implemented through Spring Boot's annotated controllers, to handle HTTP requests and responses. Hibernate was integrated with MariaDB to enable Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) and manage database transactions effectively. Additionally, real-time communication functionality was incorporated using Socket.IO for seamless chatbot interactions with pet professionals. Spring Boot facilitated easy configuration and deployment, while Hibernate streamlined the object-to-database mapping process, reducing the need for manual SQL queries. The REST principles were followed to maintain a scalable and maintainable architecture. Socket.IO, a JavaScript library, enabled bi-directional communication between the client and server, enhancing the chatbot experience. </p>
